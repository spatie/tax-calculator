A set of interfaces and methods to clean up your application's tax calculations. The `TaxCalculation` class allows you to do calculations with plain numbers and objects that implement the `HasTax` interface on the fly.

```php
use Spatie\TaxCalculator\TaxCalculation;

$items = $myCart->getItems(); // Should return an array of items that implement `HasTax`

TaxCalculation::fromCollection($items)->basePrice(); // 10.00
TaxCalculation::fromCollection($items)->taxPrice(); // 2.10
TaxCalculation::fromCollection($items)->taxedPrice(); // 12.10

$delivery = TaxCalculation::fromTaxedPrice(7.50, 0.21);

TaxCalculation::fromCollection($items)->add($delivery)->taxedPrice(); // 19.60
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/tax-calculator
```

## Usage

### Interfaces

The interfaces are provided so you can keep working with your domain objects instead of having to pass around floats everywhere. However, they're not strictly necessary to do calculations.

#### `Spatie\TaxCalculator\HasTax`

```php
public function basePrice(): float;
public function taxedPrice(): float;
public function taxPrice(): float;
```

- `basePrice`: The item's price excluding taxes
- `taxedPrice`: The item's price including taxes
- `taxPrice`: The item's tax amount (`= taxedPrice() - basePrice()`)

#### `Spatie\TaxCalculator\HasTaxWithRate`

```php
public function taxRate(): float;
```

`HasTaxWithRate` extends `HasTax`, and also has a `taxRate` method. This is useful for items that have a fixed tax rate, but can't be used on collections that contain items with various rates.

### Traits

### `Spatie\TaxCalculator\Traits\HasTaxWithRate`

The `HasTaxWithRate` trait provides default implementations of `taxPrice` and `taxedPrice`, since they can be deducted by a simple multiplication of `basePrice` and `taxRate`.
